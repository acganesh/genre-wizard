genre-wizard
============
 
A machine learning system to classify music genres from audio.  This code was written years ago, so it is very messy and out of date.  Still, I'd like to expand on these ideas eventually.

# Goals

- Try to understand the "essence" of what a musical genre means.
- Try to understand the math and physics behind music.

# Todo

- Explore Fourier analysis to model sound.
- Explore the connections between Fourier analysis and ConvNets.
- Potentially: explore Haskell implementations of GLMs or deep learning models.
- Make this code nice.
